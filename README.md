# Book Management System 📚

## **Introduction**
This project is a **Book Management System** built using **React** (with TypeScript) for the frontend and **ASP.NET Core** with **C#** for the backend. The system allows users to perform **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on books. The frontend communicates with the backend through **RESTful API** endpoints to manage books' data stored in a **SQLite** database. This project provides an opportunity to work with the integration of modern frontend and backend technologies.
